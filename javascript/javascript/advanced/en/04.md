1.  So, your to-do list works now, but it's always the same. You can fix that! The "Add" button already calls a *function*, you just need to make that *function* do something.
  Go to your JavaScript file and change the code in *addToDoItem* to get the text from the text field (named *"new-todo"*) and update the log to check you're getting it:
    ```JavaScript
    var itemText = $("input[name=new-todo]").val();
    console.log("Item added: "+itemText);
    ```
*val( )* in this case is short for value. Type something into the text field and click the "Add" button. You should see what you typed in the *console*.
2. The next step is to get that text onto the to-do list. You'll need a *function* that gets the HTML for the new item and adds it to the end of the list. So, change the *newToDoItem* to have this code inside it:
    ```JavaScript
    var newItem = {
                    "text": itemText,
                    "completed": completed
                }; // make parameters into a toDoItem
    toDoItems.push(newItem); //put newItem at the end of toDoItems
    var itemHTML = getToDoItemHTML(newItem);
    $(".todo-list").append(itemHTML);
    ```
3. Now, go back to *addToDoItem* and change it again, removing the log (if you like) and calling *newToDoItem* like this:
    ```JavaScript
    newToDoItem(itemText,false);
    ```
 > ### Don't repeat yourself!
    You can also use *newToDoItem* in *loadList* to reduce the amount of code you've got to manage. You can replace all the code in the function with this:
    ```JavaScript
    newToDoItem("My",false);
    newToDoItem("to-do",true);
    newToDoItem("list",false);
    ```
  You've gone from 17 lines of code to 3, and that's the power of functions! Try to understand how this works and how it's doing the exact same job as the old version of *loadList* was.
