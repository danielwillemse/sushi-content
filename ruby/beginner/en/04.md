1. You can ask Ruby to compare one number to another number. This can be really handy (does the player have as much money as those pants cost?). You do this using special symbols:
     * *a > b* asks if *a* is bigger than *b*
     * *a < b* asks if *a* is smaller than *b*
     * *a == b* asks if *a* is the same as *b*
     * *a != b* asks if *a* is not the same size as *b*
     * *a >= b* asks if *a* is bigger than, or the same size as *b*
     * *a <= b* asks if *a* is smaller than, or the same size as *b*  

 > ### ==
The double-equals is used to **compare** variables, because the single equals is already used **assign** values to them.

2. You use these comparisons inside *if* statements: code that should only run if a condition (in the brackets) is true. In this case, *put* some text.
    ```ruby
      if(my_number > 100)
        puts("That's a big number!")
      end
    ```
    > ### Indentation
    The *puts* is **indented**. That means that two spaces have been put before it.
    This is to make the code a bit more readble, Ruby will still know what to do if you ommit these spaces

3. Now, put that little bit of code together with your program from the last card. Change the program so it looks like this:
    ```ruby
      puts("What is your name?")
      name = gets.chomp
      puts("Hello "+name+", please pick a number")
      my_number = gets.chomp
      my_number = my_number.to_i

      if(my_number > 100)
        puts("That's a big number!")
      end
    ```
Now run it and try entering different numbers, above and below 100 to see what happens. What would happen if you entered 100 exactly?
4. You can also combine conditions, using *and* and *or*. So this let's you write code like:
    ```ruby
      if(my_number >= 20 and my_number < 30)
        puts("That number is in the twenties!")
      end
    ```
    Or, for example:
    ```ruby
      if(food == "Cake" or food == "Chocolate" or food == "Pie")
        puts("Sounds tasty!")
      end
    ```
