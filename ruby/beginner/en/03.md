1. Getting the computer to stick your name on the end of *"Hello "* is nice, but why not just write *"Hello [my name]"*? Because with a **variable** you don't have to know what's going into it when you write the program. your can even ask the user of the program to tell you what to put into it. Update your Ruby program to do that:
    ```ruby
      puts("What is your name?")
      name = gets.chomp
      puts("Hello "+name)
      puts("The Code, it's calling to you. Just let it in.")
    ```
    Try running it. You'll need to press the "Enter" key once you've typed in your name.

2. Now, try collecting a number from your user. Notice that you can use the *+* on both sides of a variable.

    Run this program, answer its questions and watch what happens.
    ```ruby
      puts("What is your name?")
      name = gets.chomp
      puts("Hello "+name+", please pick a number")
      my_number = gets.chomp
      puts("Your number is "+my_number)
    ```
3. What if you want to add a number to your variable? Add a line to your program that will add one to the *my_number* variable.
    ```ruby
      puts("What is your name?")
      name = gets.chomp
      puts("Hello "+name+", pleae pick a number")
      my_number = gets.chomp
      my_number = my_number.to_i + 1
      puts("Your number is "+my_number.to_s)
    ```
    > See that you've taken a value from a variable, changed it and stored it back in the same variable all on the same line!

    Now, why does the code have *.to_i* and *.to_s* after *my_number*?

    It's because Ruby thinks of the number '1', which it uses for maths, differently to the number '1' which it writes in a sentence. Adding *.to_i* after a variable tells it to treat it as an **integer** (a maths number), and adding *.to_s* around it tells it to treat it as a text **string**.  

    **Integers** and **strings** are variable **types** and certain pieces of code (like *+* and *puts*) only work if the variables you give them are the right type.

    You've seen how to add here, but you can also:
    * Subtract using *-*
    * Multiply using ***
    * Divide using */*
